			<p>I'm the guy on the right.</p>

			<p>My name is Aji, and I am currently a senior studying Electrical Engineering at Tufts University. I love working on cool projects, eating tasty food, and spending time with good people!</p>

			<p>I grew up in New Jersey, where I learned how to ride a bike, how to juggle, and what the extra part on the back of the stapler is for (it's for taking them out). I've been playing instruments all my life, starting on the cello in elementary school, and progressing to guitar and piano, which I now use to play requests by ear for the amusement of my suitemates.</p>
