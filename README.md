## Assignment Overview
This assignment is a website containing three pages:
- index.html: A homepage for the site, containing a picture of me and links to the other website aspects.
- bio.html: A bit of background information about me.
- resume.html: An account of my academic and professional achievements.
A single stylesheet, titled indexstyle.css, contains all the style details for the project.

## Collaboration and Discussion
I spent about 8 hours on the assignment, and did not seek help from other students during the course of working on it. I received advice from css-tricks.com concerning the web redirect, some help from w3schools.com on basic HTML syntax and use of classes, and help from the Github documentation on formatting this markdown file.
